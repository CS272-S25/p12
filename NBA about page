        <p>The NBA is widely known around the world as the best and most profittable basketball league to play in. There have been debates suggesting that the NBA isn't "international" because of it's North American playing locations.

<p2> NBA games house four quarters lasting twelve minutes for a total run-time of 48 minute games. Although the average game length goes around half-an-hour due to a fifteen minute half time break and fouling. A foul in the NBA occurs when a player does something that breaks the rules like unncessary roughness. In recent years NBA basketball players have been shooting more three point shots than ever before. </p2>
