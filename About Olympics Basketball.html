        <h3>Olympic Basketball Rules vs. NBA Basketball: A Summary</h3>
        <p>While the core objective of basketball remains the same in the Olympics and the NBA (National Basketball Association) – scoring by shooting a ball through a hoop – there are several key differences in the rules and gameplay.</p>
      
        <h4>Key Differences:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Game Length:</strong> Olympic (FIBA) games consist of four 10-minute quarters (40 minutes total), while NBA games have four 12-minute quarters (48 minutes total).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fouls:</strong> In the Olympics, a player is disqualified after committing 5 personal fouls. In the NBA, the limit is 6 personal fouls. Technical fouls count towards the player's foul count in the Olympics but not in the NBA. This means NBA players can accumulate up to 6 personal fouls and two technical fouls before getting ejected.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Timeouts:</strong> Olympic teams have fewer timeouts available compared to NBA teams, and the rules for calling them can differ, especially in the final minutes. Olympic timeouts are also typically shorter.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Goaltending:</strong> Olympic (FIBA) rules allow players to touch the ball after it hits the rim, even if it's on a downward trajectory. NBA rules prohibit any interference once the ball is on its downward path towards the basket. Cleanblocks unfortunately can be counted as goaltending when the ball is on a downward trajectory.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Three-Point Line:</strong> The three-point line is slightly closer to the basket in Olympic (FIBA) basketball (6.75 meters) compared to the NBA (ranging from 7.24 meters straightaway to 6.70 meters in the corners). NBA players find it easier to shoot 3s during the Olympics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Court Dimensions:</strong> Olympic basketball courts are slightly smaller than NBA courts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Shot Clock After Offensive Rebound:</strong> While both use a 24-second shot clock, after an offensive rebound, the shot clock resets to 14 seconds in both NBA and FIBA (Olympics).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Defensive Three-Second Rule:</strong> The NBA has a defensive three-second rule, restricting how long a defender can stay in the painted area without actively guarding an opponent. This rule does not exist in Olympic (FIBA) basketball, which can lead to different defensive strategies. This rule stops players from camping under the basket.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Jump Ball Situations:</strong> The NBA uses jump balls to determine possession throughout the game. Olympic rules use an alternating possession rule after the initial jump ball.
          </li>

        </ul>
      
        <h4>Relationship to NBA Basketball:</h4>
        <p>Despite these differences, the fundamental skills and strategies of basketball translate between the two. Many NBA players participate in the Olympics, requiring them to adapt to the FIBA ruleset for the duration of the tournament. And to be frank it's a little easier playing in Olympic basketball than the NBA. While the nuances can impact gameplay and strategy, the high level of athleticism and basketball IQ prevalent in the NBA often allows these players to adjust and compete effectively under Olympic rules. The past two decades of Olympics basketball gold medalists reflects that statement.</p>
